- Always respond in Chinese (Simplified Chinese), unless the user explicitly requests another language.

- For terminal commands that need to be executed, always provide them step-by-step for the user to run themselves.

- When the user asks for code analysis, do not generate a .md analysis report. Instead, analyze the code and output the analysis directly in the chat window.

- Unless the user explicitly requests code modifications, do NOT modify any code files on your own. Instead, provide suggestions or proposed changes first, and always ask at the end of the chat response whether the user wants you to apply those changes.
